Once linked, the proportion of observed vessels using or not using AIS/VMS can be easily calculated by fishery across multiple spatial and temporal scales.","use SEFES, a spatially explicit surfclam fishery economic modeling approach, to simulate fishing behavior under the offshore wind development scenarios. This model was created prior to 2013 and thus required upgrades to the model will be necessary. These updates will be minimal and largely limited to updating parameterization associated with vessel operations and economics, and configuration of the clam stock spatial distribution","conducting experiments and observations of longfin squid, black sea bass and the surrounding ecosystem at set distances before, during and after pile driving events (or control, no-sound days). The project will follow a before-during-and-after gradient (BAG) design, where potential significant changes from baseline in the variables of interest are assessed using statistical methods that allow for the exploration of changes in spatial relationships over time.","Controlled exposure studies to evaluate behavioral and physiological effects in a laboratory setting experimentation evaluating behavior and habitat use during sound exposure","utilize autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with a hydrophone tuned to acoustically detect soniferous fish in BOEM lease areas continuously (one deployment per month) over an initial 12 month period. The second and third 12-month periods would focus AUV activity over areas identified in the first year of surveys to further resolve spatial and temporal use of biologically active areas. By having the study extend into 2021 there are increased chances that the study will coincide with offshore wind construction activities.","To be determined","Sampling design is informed by power analysis. Adaptive sampling strategy will be employed; Environmental data: Sea state, wind speed, depth, bottom T logger; Vertical CTD profile. Biological data: Total weight of each species (CPUE; kg); Individual lengths and weights for priority species","A team of fish sound experts will be assembled to query the research community for which species have been recorded, and a list of acoustically-active Atlantic fish species would be identified. Automatic detection algorithms will be developed for these species and will be tested against a human analyst using existing long-term passive acoustic recordings from a previous BOEM project. A searchable, relational database with a web-based graphical user interface will be developed to describe the behavioral context of sounds recorded, environmental conditions, etc. Recordings of fish sounds will be placed into the Macauley Library of Natural Sounds at Cornell University. If additional recordings from new species are needed, these will be collected as an add-on to other research projects.","• Couple the scallop-IBM model with a high-resolution (up to ~1.0 m), wind turbine-resolving subdomain FVCOM ocean model under the framework of NECOFS (NS-FVCOM-scallop-IBM);\r\n• Identify years which show the connectivity of sea scallop population between Georges Bank/Great South Channel and New England shelf as well as MidAtlantic Bight through the scallop-IBM experiments for 1978-2016;\r\n• Repeat the scallop-IBM experiments for those years under the 3-D physical fields from NS-FVCOM for the cases with and without inclusion of wind turbines;\r\n• Conduct sensitivity analysis of larval transport/dispersion, subsequent recruitment and connectivity between regions (e.g., GB to MAB) to the offshore wind turbine development as spawning patterns/locations and intensities change on the upstream GB and GSC;\r\n• Repeat the above experiments with different designs of offshore wind turbine development","Develop an appropriate methodology for the collection and analysis of substrate-borne vibroacoustic disturbances based on preliminary study results from a currently BOEM- funded project (AT-2022-08). Then, using that methodology, additional substrate-borne mechanical wave measurements would be made on at least one newly approved offshore wind project (e.g., Vineyard Wind and/or South Fork Wind) during construction activities. Vibroacoustic data would be collected at various distances from the source and sediment depths using appropriate geoacoustic sensors. For field data collection, vessel(s) will be needed to deploy and retrieve acoustic sensors and recording equipment. Finally, the data will be analyzed to in a way that propagation models can be developed in the future for impact assessments.","Various","Tagging/telemetry"],"animal_group":["Highly Migratory

Include targeted sampling of benthic community structure (infauna and epifauna) in representative substrate types (e.g., mud, sand, gravel, cobble, and boulder in high and low energy environments) across multiple environmental settings.","Do we know enough about habitat and species distributions in time and space (particularly winter/summer)","How are population dynamics and community structure affected throughout the lifecycle of an OSW farm?•Are energy pathways and trophic interactions altered by the presence of OSW farm development?•What is the net effect of new hard substrate provided by OSW structures for benthic communities in both soft and rocky habitats?•How is this new habitat used by larval stages of local species and potentially invasive, nonnative species?","There are potentially competing pressures of increased epifauna populations on primary productivity and nutrient cycling in local ecosystems (Degraer et al. 2020). Data from the Baltic Sea suggest mussels decrease primary productivity (e.g., via filter-feeding), but it is a relatively localized effect. Mussels also increase nutrient cycling and can positively affect primary productivity, so assessment of effects depends on the scale being examined. Questions of scale are very important for assessing effects to understand the degree to which changes detectable at a broad scale.","List of multiple fish species that all have their own discussions about the species based on population and how they are affected by Offshore Wind Projects.(See Table 2)","Does the biofilter effect influence food availability for planktivorous larval fishes?","Studies of the relative utilization of diverse types of nature-based design structures that might be used for enhancement of habitat value of scour protection would be very useful (particularly with regards to jacket foundations and floating wind turbines).","The introduced hard substrata of OSW turbines may offer spawning habitat for several species groups, including benthic fish or squid, that use hard substrata for egg attachment. However, it remains unknown whether and which species may benefit from such increased spawning habitat.","Turbine foundations and associated scour protection layers (SPL), possibly including nature inclusive designs (NIDs), offer artificial habitat to species. The structural and functional ecology of artificial hard substrata is known to significantly differ from that of natural hard substrata in other contexts, possibly attributed to differences in habitat heterogeneity and spatial extent.","Where are the areas of high benthic productivity?  Areas and habitats of high ecological importance should be approached with high caution when siting OSW facilities. Areas of high benthic productivity are considered ecologically important. We know that high productivity in benthos cascades up to higher trophic levels and also links to ecosystem services. The current distribution of these areas, however, remains unknown","The ecology of OSW farms may be influenced by the distance between turbine foundations. The turbine foundations can be considered isolated reef hotspots but will have a degree of connectivity between them, which may vary depending on habitat type. If they are in soft-sediment habitats, turbine foundations ecology is more distinct to surrounding sediment, while in boulder fields, natural hard habitat exists. While pelagic larval dispersal may not be hampered by the distance between the turbine foundations within an OSW farm, it may affect the connectivity between turbines of mobile species like fishes.","Focus on understanding the potential behavioral effects of particle motion, substrate vibration, and sound pressure at all life stages for species of concern. All sound-related effects should be considered collectively; it should be standard practice to examine seabed vibration and particle motion alongside sound pressure in research studies where appropriate (e.g., substrate vibration is going to be important for species and life history stages that utilize the seabed). Substrate vibration, in particular, is poorly understood at present, especially in terms of the biological effects of vibration sensitivity pressure (Roberts and Elliot 2017; Hawkins et al. 2021); it will be important to develop a better understanding of potential substrate vibrationrelated sound impacts from OSW on aquatic animals in or near the seabed.","Turbine foundations and SPL could be intentionally designed to be more diverse and complex (i.e., nature-inclusive designs) by providing different spacing, hiding places, feeding places, types of stone, characteristics of concrete, and other characteristics. Topographical habitat complexity drives biodiversity (Liversage et al. 2017, Loke et al. 2017) can be added to surfaces (e.g., addition of large boulders to a regular scour protection layer), which may be desirable as natural hard substrates are often more diverse than artificial ones","Describe and quantify ecosystem/habitat by identifying the location, timing, quantity of key seafloor and water column habitat features, including moraines, bedrock outcrops, ledges and canyons, flats, depressions (e.g., the Mud Hole), location of fronts and tide rips, persistent high chlorophyll a areas, known spawning areas, corals, sponges, attached submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), high densities of shellfish or echinoderms","Does the artificial reef effect export measurable amounts of energy and biomass to the wider ecosystem or only serve locally as aggregating devices?","Habitat mapping is a foundation for many other studies.

Include targeted sampling of benthic community structure (infauna and epifauna) in representative substrate types (e.g., mud, sand, gravel, cobble, and boulder in high and low energy environments) across multiple environmental settings, such as OSW sites.","The role of wind extraction in the wake of a turbine, on surface wind stress is poorly considered and largely unstudied. This process could be important and may interact or counteract mixing, if there is any, due to pilings.","Presumably the reduction in surface wind stress in the vicinity of offshore wind farms will reduce upper ocean turbulence and mixing, however there are few studies of this topic, and none considering the specific conditions of the Mid-Atlantic Bight.","The interaction between wind wakes and impacts to oceanic processes is not fully understood and difficult to separate from natural variability. The formation of a microclimate is also less understood (changes in temperature and moisture downwind), in particular for Mid-Atlantic ocean and atmospheric conditions.","Develop an improved understanding of the net effects of wind field modification and in-situ structure friction. Consider regional wind-wake/hydrodynamic effects from multiple offshore wind farms.","How far these impacts are discernable, i.e., how far do these impacts reach before flows return to ambient?

(3)  Post-construction monitoring studies to determine frequency of secondary gear entanglements and impacts on marine species, including managed fishery species.","Unlike commercial fisheries, recreational effort data is generally lacking in proposed wind energy areas, which complicates efforts to assess potential impacts to large recreational fisheries operating in these areas. Surveys and reports of catch data from the Large Pelagics Survey, Marine Recreational Information Program, and Vessel Trip Reports provide critical spatial information on HMS interactions with fisheries and should be expanded to increase their capacity to assess the impacts of offshore wind development on fishing industries (Kneebone and Capizzano 2020). It would also be beneficial to set up a recreational reporting program that includes effort, through something as extensive as NOAA Fisheries Study Fleet or something less invasive like a mobile app.","Monkfish was proposed as a species to monitor to assess adverse & beneficial impacts of wind farm development in MA & RI-MA WEAs.","Determine and monitor long-term impacts of abandoned infrastructure on fishing grounds and fish populations","Identify and develop new survey approaches: Evaluate or develop appropriate statistical designs, sampling protocols, and methods, while determining if scientific data quality standards for the provision of management advice are maintained.","Develop interim provisional survey indices:  Develop interim indices from existing data sets to partially bridge the gap in data quality and availability between pre-construction, and operational periods while new approaches are being identified, tested or calibrated.","Develop a long-term, highly instrumented field research site that can be worked at year-round, has well-defined acoustics, and ideally allows (1) control of the sounds being added to the ambient soundscape, (2) tests on various authentic substrates, focal species, etc., (3) examination of particle motion and substrate vibration (not just sound pressure), and (4) behavioral and physiological response studies. The proposed test site could be thought of as a Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site for sound and acoustic equipment testing11. Hawkins and Chapman (2020) discussed the establishment and operation of an analogous field site at Loch Torridon, Scotland. The U.S. Navy also hasa test site at Seneca Lake, New York (described in Popper et al. 2007), though not an appropriate ecosystem for learning about marine OSW. It would be important at such a site to carefully consider inclusivity and accessibility for a wide range of researchers.","Existing sound mitigation methods such as bubble curtains that were designed for marine mammals may be ineffective for fishes and invertebrates, including benthic specialists, due to the frequencies at which existing abatement methods are most effective and where in the environment such efforts are directed (Thomsen and Verfuss 2019). Moreover, since many fishes and invertebrates live close to the bottom, they may be affected by energy that arises from the portions of the pile in the substrate (Hawkins et al. 2021). This energy may come out of the substate into the water well beyond any mitigation method (Popper and Hastings 2009). There are no known devices that will mitigate energy in the substrate.","The BOEM RODEO project at Block Island produced reports on pile driving sound, operational sound, and particle motion, and a second RODEO project is planned for 2020-2022, so this was not identified as an unmet need. However, workgroup members noted that long-term intensive monitoring sites in Europe have greatly added to the knowledge base of OSW effects on wildlife and have been an important supplement to site-specific studies at individual wind farms; as such, a longer-term intensive monitoring effort at one or more sites may still be of some utility.","Pressure to shellfish.","Measurements of pressure and particle motion field from driving large monopiles, with and without attenuation systems.

Specifically, which species may colonize structures will partially depend on local populations as well as newly introduced non-native invasive species transported from local ports and harbors to OSW areas. OSW habitats may act as ‘stepping-stones’ to non-native invasive species facilitating their spread to new areas not previously available to them. This question addresses the presence and potential effects of non-native invasive species in OSW areas as well as the contribution to wider population expansion. There is a lack of studies comparing non-native invasive species in OSW areas and control areas (i.e., are OSW areas different from any other disturbed areas/artificial structures?).","Species-specific spill-over rates (i.e., increased fish abundances on wind farm margins)","Regional research and monitoring: Establish an ecoregion-wide research and monitoring program that efficiently and effectively targets the spatio-temporal scales relevant for community interactions.

These programs have collected decades of baseline data on HMS presence and movements in proposed wind energy areas (e.g., Kohler and Turner 2019, Kneebone and Capizzano 2020), and therefore will play a key role in monitoring for changes in HMS presence and movements due to offshore wind activity. Although there is no associated effort, tag and recapture events from these programs also provide data on fishery interactions within proposed wind energy areas (Kneebone and Capizzano 2020).","Is the seasonal release of vast amounts of meroplanktonic larvae from OWF-enhanced epibenthic species detrimental for the survival of fish larvae, because they compete with the anyhow miniaturized copepods?","Is the dominant blue mussel a dead end for a classic trophic food web, since their consumption by top predators is low in comparison to their biomass (Pezy et al., 2020), eventually leading to oxygen minimum zones?

Habitat suitability modeling is and has already been used to predict deep-sea coral distributions in the NE. Can adapt models to support other habitat research such as predicting habitat effects related to aquaculture expansion and potential offshore wind energy areas. Monthly modeling could predict when and where seasonal migrations (versus summer residence) may be affected by climate change and when and where interaction with offshore wind construction activities and permanent habitat alterations may occur so as to better facilitate mitigation plans.
